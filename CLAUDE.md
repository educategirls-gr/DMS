## ⚠️ Deployment Architecture — Read Before Redeploying

`dms.dataimpact.in` is a **static `index.html` (repo root) served via GitHub Pages** (see `CNAME`). It talks to the
backend via a hardcoded `GAS_URL` constant in that file — a specific Apps Script **deployment ID**, not `@HEAD`.

This means **`clasp push` alone never updates the live site** — it only updates the script's `@HEAD` (dev) version.
To actually ship a change to `dms.dataimpact.in`:
1. `git pull` first — this repo has drifted out of sync with GitHub before (local sat 10 commits behind), and
   force-pushing stale local files to Apps Script silently reverted a live bug fix (OTP epoch-millis parsing).
2. Check `index.html`'s current `GAS_URL` (root file, not `src/ui/Index.html`) to find the deployment ID actually in use — CLAUDE.md's own URL above can drift out of sync with it (has happened at least twice).
3. `clasp deploy -i <that deployment ID> -d "description"` — redeploying to the *wrong* deployment ID (e.g. the
   `AKfycbxpUe9Q...` one, which is unused) is a silent no-op for real users but easy to mistake for success.
4. If anything breaks for all users after a deploy (e.g. login fails system-wide), `clasp versions` to find the
   last-known-good version number and `clasp deploy -i <id> -V <n>` to roll back immediately — sheet/data-only
   fixes (like backfilling a column) are independent of which code version is live, so a rollback won't undo them.

There is also a separate in-Apps-Script UI (`src/ui/Index.html`) served directly off the GAS exec URL — distinct
codepath from the root `index.html`, kept in sync manually.

## Circulars & Orders — Special Flow

Team Lead uploads circulars received from Govt/State. This is separate from normal document upload.

**Upload Flow (Team Lead):**
1. TL selects "Circular" type upload
2. Fills: Title, Reference Number (optional), Date, Remarks
3. Attaches file (PDF)
4. System sends email notification to ALL managers:
   > "Naya Circular: [Title] — Please acknowledge receipt"

**Manager Dashboard — Circulars Section:**
- List of all circulars (newest first)
- Status badge: `Acknowledged ✅` / `Pending ⏳`
- [View/Download] button
- [Maine padh liya ✅] button — one-time, cannot undo

**TL Dashboard — Circular Tracker:**

| Circular Title | Date | Total | Acknowledged | Pending | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exam Schedule 2025 | Apr 2025 | 7 | 5 | 2 | [View Details] |

Detail view dikhata hai: kaun-kaun ne acknowledge kiya, kaun-kaun pending hai (naam ke saath).

**Super Admin:** Same view as TL — full visibility.

---

## Document Lifecycle / Status Flow

```
Pending → TL_Verified → Admin_Approved → Archived
       ↘ TL_Rejected              ↘ Admin_Rejected
```

Status values: `pending`, `tl_verified`, `tl_rejected`, `admin_approved`, `admin_rejected`, `archived`

---

## Google Sheets Structure

**Spreadsheet name**: `DMS_Database`

### Tab: Users
```
email | name | role | folder_id | created_at | is_active
```

### Tab: Documents
```
doc_id | uploader_email | uploader_name | component | sub_component |
subject | description | file_name | drive_link | year | month |
status | tl_verified_by | tl_verified_at | tl_remark |
admin_approved_by | admin_approved_at | admin_remark | uploaded_at
```

### Tab: Dropdowns
```
component | sub_component | description | template_link
```
*(Managed by super_admin — all dropdowns cascade from here)*

### Tab: AuditLog
```
timestamp | user_email | user_name | action | doc_id | file_name | ip_note
```

### Tab: Circulars
```
circular_id | title | ref_number | uploaded_by | drive_link |
file_name | remarks | uploaded_at | total_managers
```

### Tab: CircularAck (Acknowledgements)
```
circular_id | manager_email | manager_name | acknowledged_at
```

### Tab: OTPStore (temporary, cleared after use)
```
email | otp | expires_at | used
```

## Drive Folder Structure

```
DMS_Documents/  (root folder)
├── Alok_Mohan/
│   └── 2025/
│       ├── April/
│       └── May/
├── Shreya_Singh/
│   └── 2025/
│       └── ...
└── [Manager_Name]/
```

Folders auto-created on first upload — never manually.

---

## File Naming Convention

```
[Component]_[SubComponent]_[Month]_[Year]_[UploaderName].pdf
Example: ICT_Hardware_April_2025_Alok.pdf
```

Auto-generated at upload time — user does not type the filename.

---

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters email (must be educategirls.ngo domain)
2. Sheet check: is user registered in Users tab?
3. Generate 6-digit OTP → send via MailApp
4. OTP expiry: **10 minutes**
5. OTP verified → PropertiesService session token created
6. Role detected → role-specific dashboard shown

---

## Login / Session Rules

- Domain restricted: `educategirls.ngo` only
- Session stored in `PropertiesService` (user-scoped)
- Session token expires after inactivity
- OTP is single-use (marked `used=true` after verification)

---

## Upload Flow

1. Manager selects **Component** (from Dropdowns sheet)
2. **Sub-component** auto-loads (filtered cascade)
3. **Description** auto-fills (editable)
4. **Subject** typed manually by user
5. File attached (PDF/DOCX/image)
6. Auto file name generated
7. Script finds/creates Drive folder: `Root/UploaderName/Year/Month/`
8. File uploaded to Drive
9. Entry added to Documents sheet
10. AuditLog entry written
11. Confirmation shown to user

---

## Download Logic

- **Single download**: Direct Drive link → opens/downloads file
- **Bulk download** (TL + Admin): Selected files → temp shared Drive folder → share link
- **Metadata export** (Admin only): Documents sheet filtered data → Excel/CSV download
- All downloads logged in AuditLog

---

## Verification Flow (Team Lead)

- TL sees list of `pending` documents from all managers
- Each row has **[Verify ✅]** and **[Reject ❌]** buttons
- Reject requires mandatory remark/reason text
- On verify: status → `tl_verified`, manager gets email notification
- On reject: status → `tl_rejected`, manager gets email with TL's remark

---

## Search & Filter Logic

Filters available on document list:
- **Year** (dropdown)
- **Month** (dropdown)
- **Component** (dropdown)
- **Sub-component** (dropdown, filtered by component)
- **Status** (dropdown)
- **Free text search** (matches subject or file_name)
- **Uploader** (visible to TL and Admin only)

All filtering is client-side JS using data fetched from Sheets.

---

## Notification Triggers

| Event | Who Gets Notified |
|---|---|
| Manager uploads doc | Team Lead gets email |
| TL verifies doc | Manager gets confirmation email |
| TL rejects doc | Manager gets rejection reason email |
| Admin approves doc | Manager + TL get email |
| Admin rejects doc | Manager + TL get email |

## Key Rules for Code Generation

1. **Never hardcode Sheet ID or Folder ID** — always use `CONFIG` from Constants.gs
2. **All Drive operations** go through `DriveManager.gs`
3. **All Sheet read/write** goes through `SheetManager.gs`
4. **Session validation** at the top of every server-side function
5. **AuditLog entry** written for every upload, verify, reject, approve, download
6. **Error handling**: catch errors, log to console, return `{success: false, message: '...'}` to UI
7. **OTP**: 6-digit numeric, single-use, 10-minute expiry
8. **File naming**: auto-generate, never trust user-provided filename
9. **Domain check**: reject any email not ending in `@educategirls.ngo`
10. **Role check**: enforce permissions server-side, not just UI-side
